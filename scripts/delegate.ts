/*This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each accountâ€™s vote power. 
Vote power can be delegated either by calling the delegate function directly, 
or by providing a signature to be used with delegateBySig. 
Voting power can be queried through the public accessors getVotes and getPastVotes.

By default, token balance does not account for voting power. 
This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to 
delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.*/
